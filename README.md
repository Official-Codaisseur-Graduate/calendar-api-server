# The Codaisseur Academy Calendar

The Codaisseur Academy Calendar is a platform for Codaisseur's students, teacher's assistants and teachers. Here you can view all of Codaisseur's events, which teacher is teaching what class and what lesson on a given day. You can also see special events here, for example __Taste of Code__ events or __Demo nights__.

Also, if you are given the role of an assistant you can volunteer on any event to assist a teacher in their lessons.
